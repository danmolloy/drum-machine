# FreeCodeCamp Drum Machine

by Daniel Molloy

[live example](https://danmolloy.github.io/drum-machine/)

This is a drum machine created with react for FreeCodeCamp's Front End Development Libraries, following these [user stories](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine).

Although it passes all the tests, the keydown events don't work properly. Help welcome!
